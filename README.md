# NyhetsInspektor
### Installation guide:

1. Download this repo either by cloning or as zip. For the next steps you need an unzipped version of this project.
2. Open chrome and go to _chrome:extensions_
3. Activate developer mode
4. Load unpacked
5. Open project, again unzipped version of the project!
6. It is now installed and starts downloading all the data for the different papers. (From the server, not the actual papers)
7. Open developer tools by either ctrl+i, right click with mouse then inspect or press f12.
8. Open NyhetsInspector as shown in the picture
![Where is the application?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteffenSande/NyhetsInspektoren/master/vist%C3%85pneApplikasjon.png "Where do I open the application?")
9. Go to a supported site (if already on a site that is supported you need to refresh it. This start communication between the different parts of the application)
10. If contact developer message appears it is because it is not finished loading data in the background. You can see the data loading in the background script log accessible in the extensions page. (go to _chrome:extensions_ and where it says NewsInspektor there is a link to the background script log)
11. Enjoy!
